    <h3>
      Summary
    </h3>
    <p>
      Owl2Java is a Java code generator, which generates a convenient API to work with
      data in an OWL ontology. It makes it possible to write expressive and
      easy-to-follow code that works with RDF/OWL ontologies, hiding the peculiarities of
      working with such an ontology and a library that accesses it. The code generator generates
      a Java class for each OWL class in the ontology, with static methods to retrieve and iterate
      over individuals, and with getters and setters for all of the class's properties
      Tools to enrich the structure of an OWL ontology (i.e. class and property definitions)
      are also included in the package.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Where to get it
    </h3>
    <p>
      Owl2Java is available at <a href="http://github.com/piscisaureus/owl2java">http://github.com/piscisaureus/owl2java</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Background
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the TU Delft we're trying to create a simulation that uses a semantic data set developed
      using SemanticMediaWiki. SemanticMediaWiki (or any other distributed ontology editor for
      that matter) makes it possible to collaboratively develop a knowledge body that can be used
      for many purposes. The wiki allows to export (a part of) the data in it as an OWL/RDF ontology,
      which can be used by other applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simulation model itself will be written in Java. However using an ontology in a
      strongly typed programming language like Java isn't really straightforward;
      Libraries that access instance data in an ontology do exist (like Jena), but conceptually
      simple operations often require verbose code. For example, to access a property of an OWL
      instance requires code to load the instance, then load the property definition, fetch
      the property value and finally cast it to an appropriate type. To do this right the programmer
      needs to know exactly how the property is defined within the ontology. Furthermore, the
      verbosity of this code makes it difficult to follow for a human reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make a developer's life a little more easy, Jena and many other libraries also provide the
      possibility to create 'wrapper classes' that allow an individual of a particular OWL class to
      be represented by an instance of a normal Java class, so all peculiarities of working with an
      ontology can be hidden within the wrapper class. The wrapper class exposes an easy-to-use and
      Java-like interface to the 'real' application. Writing these wrapper classes however can be a
      lot of work by itself when there are many OWL classes in the ontology; when an ontology tends
      to evolve this becomes an even bigger problem, because the wrapper classes need to be updated
      manually to keep them in sync with the ontology.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where Owl2Java helps: Owl2Java can generate these wrapper classes automatically.
      When used properly, it generates a complete and consistent interface that works for all classes
      within an OWL ontology. And, provided that the user doesn't change the generated code, it can
      always be re-run after the ontology has been updated. The generated code uses Jena
      underneath; when desired, advanced Jena features such as performing SPARQL queries can still
      be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other issue that we ran into at the TU Delft is that the ontology exported by
      SemanticMediaWiki isn't always complete in terms of structure. Specifically, certain aspects
      of OWL properties such as range, domain and functional-ness aren't defined in the wiki
      export. Therefore we included some tools to enrich an ontology's structure by examining
      individuals. Imperfect as the results may be, it generally finds a structure
      that's <em>almost</em> right, limiting the amount of manual editing required.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Using Owl2Java
    </h2>
    <p>
      Writing an application using Owl2Java generally consists of three stages. First, the
      ontology's structure needs to be checked and optionally fixed. The second step is to generate
      the wrapper classes, which can then be used to write an appliction.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Structuring the ontology
    </h3>
    <p>
      In order for the code generator to work properly you must make sure that the ontology
      has a 'complete' structure:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Classes must be defined in the ontology; Owl2Java generates a java class for each of
      them.
      </li>
      <li>Properties must be defined in the ontology; Owl2Java generates getter and setter methods
      for them.
      </li>
      <li>Properties need to have one or multiple classes in its domain; these are the classes that
      the get/setters will be added to.
      </li>
      <li>Properties need to have a range (a class or a data type), otherwise the getters will
      return an object of type owl:Thing. Properties may have multiple ranges, but Owl2Java doesn't
      support complex constructs (i.e. anonymous classes) here.
      </li>
      <li>If you want to have a singular getter, i.e. getSomething() instead of listSomething(),
      you'll need to make the property functional or set is maximum cardinality to one.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Not all ontologies may have a structure as complete as this. As said, at the TU Delft we work
      with ontologies created with SemanticMediaWiki, which defines classes and properties but
      doesn't add any information about domains, ranges and does not declare any property
      functional. To help fixing this some structure-finding tools are included with Owl2Java.
      These are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>PropertyDomainInferer</em><br />
        Find the domain(s) for a property by looking at the
        instances that use this property. Existing domains are retained, unless a superclass of the
        existing domain is found. You may need to run ThingExtender (see below) first.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>PropertyRangeInferer</em><br />
        Find the range(s) for a property by looking at what the
        property refers to when used by instances. Existing ranges are kept, unless a superclass of
        an existing range class is found. You may need to run ThingExtender and
        PropertyRangeSimplifier first.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>FunctionalPropertyInferer</em><br />
        Look for properties that are never used more than once
        per instance, and assume these properties are functional. This may lead to false positives;
        review the output ontology after running it. Existing functional properties are retained.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>PropertyRangeSimplifier</em><br />
        Simplify range definitions so the code generator doesn't
        choke on it. Some ontology editors (Prot&eacute;g&eacute; for example) use complex
        structures such as anonymous intersection/union classes to denote that a class property may
        have multiple ranges. This tool simply converts anything crazy to a flat list of named
        classes, which the code generator can work with. Generally you'll want to use this just
        before invoking the class generator to make sure it is run every time after the ontology
        was edited. Also run it before invoking PropertyRangeInferer when the ontology already has
        some ranges defined.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>ThingExtender</em><br />
        Make sure all classes (indirectly) extend owl:Thing.
        PropertyDomainInferer and PropertyRangeInferer require that owl:Thing is always at the top
        of the inheritance chain to function properly. Use ThingExtender before running the
        range/domain inferrers just to be sure.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All these tools are used in a similar way:
    </p>
<pre>
IOntologyPreprocessor structureTool = <span style="font-weight: bold;">new</span> <span style="color: rgb(54, 95, 145);">StructureTool</span>( <span style="color: gray;">[</span><span style="color: rgb(54, 95, 145);">options&hellip;</span><span style="color: gray;">]</span> )
structureTool.process( OntModel ontology );
</pre>
    <p>
      Suppose you have an ontology but the structure is incomplete, and you want to fix it up.
      Create a small program that loads and ontology, runs some of the structure finding tools and
      then writes it back to another ontology.

    <h3>
      Generate wrapper classes
    </h3>
    <p>
      Generating the java classes should be rather straightforward; it's as simple as loading an
      ontology, choose in which package and directory the generated classes should be placed and
      then call the code generator. You should run the range simplifier (see above) just
      before invoking the class generator to make sure the code generator doesn't choke on
      range definitions that are too complex for it to handle.

</pre>

    <h3>
      Use the generated classes in your application
    </h3>
    <p>
      After generating code to work with the ontology, you may start building your own application.
      It is recommended that you do not make any modifications to the generated code. This will
      allow you to just re-run the code generator when something in the ontology changes without
      losing your own code.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Initializing the wrapper classes
    </h4>
    <p>
      At the start of your application, you need register all generated classes with Jena. It's as
      simple as:
    </p>
<pre>
Factory.<span style="font-style: italic;">registerCustomClasses</span>();
</pre>
    <p>
      Obviously you need to load an ontology to work with. Use Jena for it. You may optionally set
      a 'default' ontology that is used when creating/loading/listing ontology instances. This is
      recommended; if you don't do that you need to supply the ontology every time you're
      loading or creating instances.
    </p>
<pre>
<span style="color: rgb(63, 127, 95);">// Load the ontology</span>
OntModel ontModel = OntologyUtils.<span style="font-style: italic;">loadOntology</span>(<span style="color: rgb(42, 0, 255);">"file:resources/demo/industries-application.owl"</span>);

<span style="color: rgb(63, 127, 95);">// Set default ontology to load instances from</span>
Factory.<span style="font-style: italic;">setDefaultModel</span>(ontModel);
</pre>
    <p>
      After that, you can work with ontology instances almost like normal java objects.
      What you can expect the generated classes to look like will be explained next.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Class hierarchy
    </h4>
    <p>
      As said, Owl2Java generates a class for each class defined in the ontology.
    </p>
    <p>
      However Java does not support multiple inheritance like Owl does, therefore generated Java
      classes do not extend their OWL 'parent' - they only extend the generic IndividualImpl class
      from Jena. However for each class there is also an interface generated, which <em>does</em>
      reflect the OWL inheritance chain. This is what the wrapper class/interface definition
      for a particular OWL will look like:
    </p>
<pre>
<span style="color: rgb(127, 0, 85); font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="color: rgb(127, 0, 85); font-weight: bold;">interface</span> IMyClass <span style="color: rgb(127, 0, 85); font-weight: bold;">extends</span> Individual, IMyAncestor, IThing {
    &hellip;
}
<span style="color: rgb(127, 0, 85); font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="color: rgb(127, 0, 85); font-weight: bold;">class</span> MyClass <span style="color: rgb(127, 0, 85); font-weight: bold;">extends</span> IndividualImpl <span style="color: rgb(127, 0, 85); font-weight: bold;">implements</span> IMyClass {
    &hellip;
}
</pre>

    <h4>
      Working with instances
    </h4>
    <p>
      Generated classes have a number of static methods to load, delete, list and iterate over
      instances of a particular OWL class. The method names should be self-explaining; however some
      details may require explanation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The OntModel parameter is always optional; if not supplied, the default ontology set
      with <em>Factory.setDefaultOntology()</em> is used.
      </li>
      <li>When creating an instance, the URI parameter may be omitted; an url for the instance
      will then be generated.
      </li>
      <li>Delete() is a static method and requires you to give it the url of the instance to be
      deleted. To remove an instance that has been 'wrapped' with get(), use the non-static remove()
      method.
      </li>
      <li>The iterate(), list() and count() methods optionally take a parameter named <em>direct</em>.
      When it is set to true, these functions consider only direct instances of this class, ignoring
      instances of subclasses. If <em>direct</em> is set to false or omitted, subclass instances are
      listed, iterated, counted too.
      </li>
    </ul>

</pre>

    <h4>
      Working with properties
    </h4>
    <p>
      The generated classes have methods to work with the properties of an OWL individual. What
      methods are available for a specific property depends on whether it is a single-value (defined
      <em>functional</em> or with maxCardinality = 1) or a multi-value (all others) property.
      Some remarks:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Replace <em>Property</em> by the name of the property. For a property named
      <em>amount</em>, the methods are called <em>getAmount</em>, <em>setAmount</em>,
      etc.
      </li>
      <li>For object properties, <em>Range</em> refers to the class of the property while
      <em>IRange</em> refers to the interface that defines it;<br />
      for datatype properties both <em>Range</em> and <em>IRange</em> are simply an
      appropriate Java primitive type.
      </li>

    <h2>
      Known issues &amp; todo
    </h2>

    <h3>
      Owl features
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add support for complex range definitions (so running PropertyRangeSimplifier is no longer necessary)</li>
      <li>Support property characteristics like maxCardinality, transitive, inverse functional</li>
      <li>Add support for primitive types like float, int, etc. (how about lists, iterators then?)</li>
      <li>Add support for XsdDuration</li>
      <li>XsdTypes entity is currently ignored</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Code generation
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Output path could be either absolute or relative to project root</li>
      <li>When writing code to somewhere outside the owl2java folder, also copy owl2java classes that the generated code depends on</li>
      <li>Use Sparql for generated count() methods</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Other
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add JavaDoc comments</li>
      <li>More examples and general documentation</li>
      <li>Make the code generator use generics instead of casts internally</li>
    </ul>
